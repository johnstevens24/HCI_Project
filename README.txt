A couple quick notes:

The formatting for this project was controlled by our professor, so while some things aren't exactly how I would have formatted them,
they had to be tailored to her specifications.

"Heart of the Problem" documents our findings about the nature of the problem and what methods users are currently using to solve it.

"Getting the Design Right" documents our multiple prototypes and the final design that we made a digital mockup of.

"Roadmappers" is the name of the group that I was in.
